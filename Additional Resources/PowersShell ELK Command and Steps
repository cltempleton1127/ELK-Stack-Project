## Elk Commands and Steps

This guide should help with step-by-step commands to SSH, start and attach containers, and ultimately navigate to the Kibana Dashboard for the ELK server.

- GitBash

  - `ssh redadmin@40.87.27.108`

  - `sudo docker container list -a`

  - `sudo docker container start tender_swartz`

  - `sudo docker container attach tender_swartz`

  - `cd /etc/ansible `

  - `ls`

    - ELK-Playbook.yml	ansible.cfg	filebeat-config.yml	hosts	metricbeat-config.yml	metricbeat-playbook.yml	pentest.yml

  - `ssh sysadmin@10.2.0.4`

  - `sudo docker container start elk`

  - http://[DynamicIP]:5601/app/kibana#/home
  The Dynamic IP referenced here will change every time your machine is restarted, so the exact URL path will also change based off of that current ELK instance public IP.
  (My initial instance URL was http://13.83.51.111/app/kibana) 

# Troubleshooting:
  - Re-run playbooks
  - Double check IP listed in URL
  - Make sure it is http not https
